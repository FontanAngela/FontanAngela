Papers 2 and 3 formulate a collective decision-making problem over cooperative and antagonistic networks, respectively, as a bifurcation problem, where the crossing of a pitchfork bifurcation corresponds to the achievement of a common decision. The results of Paper 2 admit a natural interpretation in the context of social networks, and Paper 1 proposes a concrete example of political decision-making.


## Contributions of selected publications ##

In my research work, a decision-making process in presence of antagonism is formulated as a nonlinear interconnected dynamical model over signed networks. 
As linear models may fail to capture complex behaviors, the adoption of nonlinearities is motivated by an effort to make the models more realistic. In particular, the selected publications use the model for collective decision-making introduced in [[1](#references)], which is characterized by saturated nonlinearities (describing how the agents transmit their opinion to their neighbors in the network). To extend this model to include competition between the agents (which is not considered in [[1](#references)]), the proposed idea is to consider signed networks, i.e., graphs whose edges have positive or negative weight [[2](#references)]), to model cooperation/friendship/trust or competition/antagonism/distrust between the agents. 

The aim is to investigate the behavior of thismultiagent system, and to understand how it is affected by the presence of antagonism. Indeed, when competition is taken into account, it may lead to conflicts or social tensions during the decision-making process: for this reason, the notion of "frustration" of the signed network representing the community is introduced, to quantify the amount of "disorder" introduced by the antagonistic interactions among the agents. 
Real-world signed networks, from e.g., biological networks [[3](#references),[4](#references),[5](#references)] to social networks [[6](#references),[7](#references)] and (multi-party) parliamentary networks [[8](#references)], have in general nonzero frustration, which further motivates the analysis. 

In the selected publications, it is shown that the behavior of the nonlinear model can be described by means of bifurcation analysis, with the equilibria of the system encoding the possible decisions. From a deadlock situation (i.e., no decision is taken), a decision is reached only if the agents have the "right" amount of social effort/commitment (represented as a bifurcation parameter in the model).
While the qualitative bi-furcation behavior of the model does not change when antagonistic interactions between the agents are taken into account, at the same time it is shown that the higher is the "frustration" of the signed network, the higher is the social effort required from the agents to break the deadlock.

The government formation process in countries with a parliamentary system is a good example of collective decision-making applied to the field of Political Sciences, with parliamentary members (MPs) acting as agents, and vote of confidence given to the post-election candidate cabinet coalition as decision.
The post-election government negotiation talks might be a long and complex process, and the research question is whether it is possible to use the proposed model for collective decision-making to explain this behavior. The approach is to treat the government formation processas a collective decision-making system over a signed "parliamentary" network (mapping the post-election parliament), where the social effort required from the MPs is a proxy for the duration of the government negotiation talks. 
The hypothesis, supported by the analysis of legislative elections in 29 European countries in the last 40 years, is that the frustration of the parliamentary network should correlate well with the duration of the government negotiation talks: a long period of negotiationsis to be expected when the social tension in the parliament is high.
